            I'm deeply interested in how technology can be used to solve real world problems and enhance user experiences. In addition, I have a strong curiosity for game design theory, which includes understanding what makes games engaging, intuitive, and rewarding. 
            I also value lifelong learning and often try to explore new frameworks and programming techniques to broaden my perspective and understanding.
