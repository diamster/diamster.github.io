                During my free time, I enjoy gaming, watching anime, and reading fiction. I also spend time experimenting with new code or testing new frameworks. 
                Futhermore, I am someone who enjoys a challenge, thus I've earned Platinum trophies in several PlayStation games, which reflects my persistence and determination to see tasks through to completion. 
                These hobbies not only help me unwind but often inspire ideas for personal projects and ideas.
